## Scheduling and deadlock algorithms in C
When you talk about operating system various process scheduling algorithms come to your mind some which have been discussed here along with the code files in C.
Check this link for further explaination - https://www.gatevidyalay.com/operating-system/
- fcfs-first come first served
- fifo-first in first out
- sjf-shortest job first
- srtf-shortest remaining time first
- RR - round robin algorithm
- priority - priority based scheduling
- pre_priority - premptive priority based scheduling
- banker - banker's deadlock avoidance algorithm
- LRU - least recently used (page replacement algorithm)
- cscan - disk sceduling algorithm 
- sstf - disk scheduling algorith
